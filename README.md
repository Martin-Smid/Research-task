**Research Task: *Simulations and Tests of Higher-Spin Ultra-Light Dark Matter*.** \
This project focuses on creating and refining simulation tools for axion-like particle dark matter. The aim is to simulate and test models of ultra-light dark matter, particularly those involving higher-spin particles. The work involves:

Reviewing literature on the dark matter problem, emphasizing ultra-light dark matter models.
Utilizing and modifying computational tools for simulating cosmological structures of ultra-light dark matter.
Developing new simulation approaches tailored to ultra-light dark matter.
Extracting valuable insights from simulations and defining observational tests.
The simulations aim to advance our understanding of the properties and cosmological implications of ultra-light dark matter, contributing to broader dark matter research efforts.
